// Changed by Hookwars: program ids and derived addresses.
//! `bordrless_swap`: the Bordrless DEX.
//!
//! Constant-product pools between two Bordrless Token Standard mints. A pool has an LP fee that
//! stays in the pool, a protocol fee always taken in the quote token that the admin collects for
//! the fee collector, optional virtual reserves (a launch curve), an LP mint on the token standard,
//! and an optional hook program that runs before and after swaps and liquidity changes, can take
//! up to three deltas and a burn from a swap's input (before) and output (after), and can set the
//! LP fee of a swap (hook protocol v2, `bordrless_hook`; `docs/hooks-v2.md` §3). Every callback is
//! signed by this program's `["hook-authority", hook_program]` PDA, one per hook program, so a
//! signer one pool hook receives and passes on is never another hook's (the pool keeps the bump).
//! Each side's token-hook slice carries the token program's signer for that mint's hook.
//!
//! Amounts are measured, never assumed: the vault balance is read before and after every transfer,
//! so a token whose own hook takes a cut still prices correctly, and `min_amount_out` is checked
//! against what the recipient's holding actually gained.
//!
//! Layout: [`state`], [`instructions`] (config, pool, liquidity, swap), [`hooks`] (pool hook CPIs
//! and delta transfers), [`token`] (token standard CPIs), [`events`], [`error`], [`client`].
