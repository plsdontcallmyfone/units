// Changed by Hookwars: upgrade authorities.
/**
 * Studio and the config marketplace: the shapes the site and the backend exchange.
 *
 * Studio is where anyone designs a launch config, and optionally a token hook of their own, with an
 * assistant that knows the Bordrless programs; has it reviewed; pays the rent for Bordrless to build
 * and deploy the hook (Bordrless keeps its upgrade authority: the creator never holds it); makes the
 * config; and may list it on the marketplace, where every launch someone else makes from it pays
 * them half its creator fee, if it has one (`AUTHOR_SHARE_BPS`, `create_listed_config`,
 * docs/hooks-v2.md §5.7). That half is all a creator gets from listing.
 *
 * A Studio hook is written against one template (`STUDIO_TEMPLATE`): an Anchor program with a fixed
 * `Cargo.toml` and the standard `prepare` (`STUDIO_PREPARE`), so the site can prepare any Studio hook
 * for a new mint without knowing its code. The backend refuses source that leaves the template's
 * limits (`StaticCheck`) before it is built, reviewed or paid for.
