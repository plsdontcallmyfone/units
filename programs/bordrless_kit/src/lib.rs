// Changed by Hookwars: program ids and derived addresses.
//! `bordrless_kit`: the token hook a Bordrless launch installs for the rules it fixes at launch
//! (`docs/hooks-v2.md` §4).
//!
//! Four fixed, bounded modules ([`constants::modules`]): holder rewards (a share of each trade on
//! the launch pool, taken by the launch's pool hook, paid to holders in SOL through an exact
//! reward accounting kept in 64 bytes of each holding, claimable any time, plus shares streamed
//! over an hour), max wallet until graduation, the creator wallet lock and the early-buyer lock.
//!
//! Only the launchpad installs it: [`KitConfig`] is created only by `init`, which the launch
//! program's `["kit-caller", mint]` PDA must sign ([`constants::LAUNCH_ID`] is a constant here;
//! there is no crate dependency on the launch). A kit mint names this program as its hook with no
//! hook authority, so which program runs is fixed from the token's first instruction. A mint that
//! names the kit without a `KitConfig` can never move: every callback fails.
//!
//! The callbacks (`before_transfer`, `before_burn`) are signed by the token program's signer for
//! the kit, `["hook-authority", KIT_ID]` under the token program (a constant here, and not one any
//! other hook ever receives), bind every account they read (§4.6), make no CPI and emit no event;
//! their rules are pure functions in [`rules`], the reward math in [`math`]. `claim` and `share`
//! call the token program for the reward mint, which has no hook. [`mirror`] is the off-chain
//! mirror of what a holder can claim. [`client`] has the addresses, the flags of a module set and
//! the instruction builders the launch, the tests and the SDK use.
