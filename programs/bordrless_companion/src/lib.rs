// Changed by Hookwars: program ids and derived addresses; launch_slots.
//! `bordrless_companion`: a launch whose creator is a program (`docs/companions.md`).
//!
//! A companion is made for a mint before it exists (`create`), then creates the launch through the
//! launchpad with its creator address, `PDA(["creator", mint])`, as the launch's creator (`launch`).
//! Every creator fee then lands with the companion, and its code alone decides what happens to it:
//! bought back and burned, streamed to holders through the kit, or paid to the launcher, by the
//! split fixed at `create`. The launcher's own buy (`dev_buy`) is made by the companion and vests
//! to them (`release`). Every step but `dev_buy` is permissionless and pays its sender a bounty:
//! the token runs its rewards with no keeper and no backend to trust.
//!
//! Layout: [`state`], [`instructions`] (create and launch, the steps), [`invoke`] (how a step calls
//! another program), [`events`], [`error`], [`client`].
