// Changed by Hookwars: program ids and derived addresses.
//! `half_life`: a Bordrless token hook whose exit fee has a half-life.
//!
//! Every holding remembers how old its tokens are: the average time they arrived, kept in the 64
//! bytes of hook data the token program stores inside each holding. Tokens bought from the pool
//! arrive "now"; tokens sent wallet to wallet arrive with the sender's age, so age travels with the
//! tokens and cannot be reset or laundered by moving them. Mixing new tokens into a wallet averages
//! its age down, by weight.
//!
//! Moving tokens out of a wallet (a sell into the pool, or a transfer to anyone) pays an exit fee
//! taken from the amount itself: 20% for tokens that arrived this instant, halving every six hours
//! they are held (10% at 6 h, 5% at 12 h, 2.5% at 18 h, ...), linear within each half-life, and
//! nothing after 48 hours. Buys never pay it. The fee goes to the mint's furnace, a holding this
//! program owns, which anyone can `stoke` to burn: early sellers shrink the supply for everyone
//! who stays.
//!
//! None of this is possible with a Token-2022 transfer hook: it cannot take part of the amount,
//! it has no state inside the holding (it would need an account per holder, created and funded
//! before use and carried by every transfer), and Token-2022's own transfer fee is one rate for
//! every holder alike.
//!
//! For a launch (`docs/hooks-v2.md` §5.8): `prepare(mint)` before the launch (the mint need not
//! exist), a `LaunchConfig` naming this program with [`FLAGS`], then `light(mint)` once the mint
//! exists. Until the furnace is lit, a transfer that owes a fee fails, so nobody exits free in the
//! first blocks; buys work from the start. Every instruction but the callback is permissionless.
//!
//! The launch's own accounts are exempt: the launch PDA (the supply and the graduation reserve)
//! and the launch pool (read from the `Launch` account, so buys come out of it free and sells into
//! it are charged on the seller's side only), and the furnace.
