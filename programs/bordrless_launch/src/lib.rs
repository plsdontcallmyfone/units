// Changed by Hookwars: program ids and derived addresses.
//! `bordrless_launch`: the Bordrless launchpad (`docs/hooks-v2.md` §5).
//!
//! One transaction creates a Bordrless Token Standard mint with fixed metadata and the token rules
//! the creator chose ([`state::LaunchRules`], within the config's bounds, given inline or through
//! a [`state::LaunchConfig`] made with the SDK), mints the supply to the launch PDA, revokes the
//! mint authority, installs the token's hook when the rules need one (the kit, `bordrless_kit`,
//! for holder rewards, max wallet, the creator wallet lock and the early-buyer lock; or, from a
//! config, the creator's own hook program, prepared for the mint beforehand), and creates a curve
//! pool on the Bordrless DEX with this program as the pool's hook and most of the supply
//! deposited. Trading is then ordinary DEX swaps; this program's `before_swap` and `after_swap`
//! callbacks apply the anti-sniper LP fee and take the creator fee, the holder fee (into the kit's
//! reward vault) and the burn; the DEX takes Bordrless's share of what they collect. Once the
//! pool's quote reserve reaches the graduation threshold, anyone calls `graduate`: the reserve
//! tops the pool up so the price is continuous, the rest is burned, the DEX finalizes the curve,
//! the LP lands in the launch PDA, which has no instruction to move it, and the kit is told (max
//! wallet lifts).
//!
//! The kit is called only through this program's `["kit-caller", mint]` PDA, which signs nothing
//! else; the launch PDA and this program's hook authority are never passed to it.
//!
//! Layout: [`state`], [`instructions`] (config, launch configs, launch, graduate, claim, hook
//! callbacks), [`cpi`] (the instructions this program invokes), [`events`], [`error`], [`client`].
