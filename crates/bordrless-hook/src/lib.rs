// Changed by Hookwars: slot protocol (slot flags and kinds, TokenSlotArgs, SlotReturn, on_touch); PoolHookArgs.route (RouteContext); pool-item protocol (ItemPoolContext, ItemPoolAnswer).
//! The Bordrless hook protocol (v2), shared by the token standard (`bordrless_token`), the DEX
//! (`bordrless_swap`) and every program that implements a hook.
//!
//! A hook is an ordinary program whose instructions are named after the callbacks
//! (`before_transfer`, `after_swap`, …). The calling program invokes them by CPI with an
//! Anchor-style discriminator ([`discriminators`]) and Borsh arguments ([`TokenHookArgs`],
//! [`PoolHookArgs`]), signing with its `["hook-authority", hook_program]` PDA ([`hook_signer`]),
//! which is always the first account. The signer is one per hook program: a callback receives it
//! as a signer and could pass it on in a CPI of its own, so a hook accepts only the signer made
//! for it, and a signer passed on by another hook vouches for nothing (`docs/hooks-v2.md`,
//! implementation notes, review fixes).
//! A `before_*` callback (and a pool's `after_swap`) may answer with a [`HookReturn`] in its return
//! data: up to [`MAX_DELTAS`] cuts from the amount, each to an account the hook names, a burn and
//! an LP fee (pool swaps), and the 64 bytes of state a token hook keeps in each holding
//! ([`HOOK_DATA_LEN`]). The calling program checks the answer ([`read_answer`], [`Allowed`]) and
//! applies it; a hook never moves funds itself and never gets the user's signature.
//!
//! A hook that needs accounts of its own publishes a [`HookAccountList`] at
//! `["bordrless-hook-accounts", mint-or-pool]` under its own program id; clients resolve the list
//! and append the accounts to the instruction, after the fixed prefix.
